Rule 8: No keyboard fights

Rule 9: Bring the sauce
You should bring the sauce(source) of any spoiler or nsfw meme. This helps people know if the spoiler applies to them, and helps us determine what violates Reddit TOS.

Rule 10. Flair Accordingly
  Flair NSFW appropriately.
  --On NSFW: Not Safe For Work means exactly that. **Anything sexual or ecchi** must be flaired as such.
